# Heat-source-detection-1

### Overview
We perform deblurring of images using the MCMC approach applied to the mixed norm theorem. 
### Description
The images folder contains the images on which the deblurring has been performed. 
Utils.py contains the utlity functions for solving the reconstruction for any arbitrary kernel width using ADMM Split-Bregman. 
Deblurring.py contains the main function for deblurring using the MCMC method. 
The deblurring2d.ipynbnotebook contains all the detailed and described experiments provided in the paper and it's appendix.
